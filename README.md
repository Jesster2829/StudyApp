# Where can I access it?
This link is for our most stable version of the application.
https://studyapp-14658.web.app/

# What is it?
Its an application developed by me and 4 others, for the purpose of note taking in the upcoming semesters.
It was built using using React framework and Typescript. Deployed on Firebase and using Firebase Database. 
It was also made with MUI material library, creating an easy to use app on both web and mobile. 

# What can it do?
A user can create an account using Google Authentication. Afterwards they will have access to the ability to 
create flashcards for specific classes, make to-do lists, create notes, and mark events on calendars. 

# Is it done?
Not yet, it is currently in development. Flashcards is currently implemented on a basic level, I plan on making the ability to shuffle, 
edit and delete flash cards hopefully soon. On the home page you can create a simple to-do list, cannot delete or edit yet though. There is no 
implementation for the calendar page and notes page, but the team members are currently working on it. 

# What was I responsible for?
I was in charge of the Firebasee deployment along with the creation and structure of the Firebase Database. I was also
responsible for anything to do with the flashcards as well. This is all done, but the formatting of the flashcards is not 
complete yet, currently looks hideous
